PIC-NIC
I remember that time when I @verb@ed a person.
It was a @adjective@ day and I was @verb@ing with @propernoun@. We had decided to have a picnic and so we brought everything we needed: <a> @adjective@ tablecloth, plates, cutlery and glasses of @noun@; and to eat pizzas, <a> @noun@, some @noun@ and <a> @noun@.
They @verb@ed on the ground and started @verb@ing @adverb@. We were in <a> @adjective@ grove and nobody was there. We @verb@ed a lot, and we were eating the last pizza. They had already eaten @number@ slices, so the last one was mine.
@propernoun@ pointed to me and exclaimed: "Look, <a> @noun@!" And I, @adjective@, turned around @adverb@, but there was nothing. When I turned back, I saw him eating my last slice of pizza!
I @verb@ed the first object at hand, which was <a> @noun@ and I stuck it in the @noun@. They @verb@ed and fell to the @adjective@ ground.
@adverb@, I dug a hole and threw my friend's @adjective@ body into it and went off pretending nothing happened.
NO ONE CAN TOUCH MY PIZZA!

LETTER FROM AFAR
Dear @propernoun@,
I miss you so much and I would like to be with you now. Here it is truly @adjective@.
@number@ @noun@s have passed since the last time we @verb@ed.
Here the days go by @adverb@ and if it weren't for my @adjective@ job I wouldn't be here. The weather here is always @adjective@ and people behave @adverb@.
Yesterday, for example, a person @verb@ed me and yelled at me: "@verb@, @noun@!", Even if I hadn't done anything.
My work here is quite @adjective@, a week ago I @verb@ed <a> @noun@ of @noun@ and they complimented me.
I met the only nice person here, his name is @propernoun@ and he is <a> @adjective@ boy.
They told me that I can @verb@ again in @number@ days, I can't wait! I miss my house a lot and I will be finally able to @verb@ it.
Your @adjective@ @propernoun@

COMPETITION
I am so @adjective@, I can't wait to start.
I am <a> @noun@! I have @verb@ed for so much time. The leading competitor is @propernoun@, <a> @adjective@ man with @number@ @noun@s in place of the @noun@ and he is at @number@ points.
Suddenly I hear my name called from the @noun@. It's my turn to @verb@. I @verb@ the @noun@. They give me @noun@s to throw. I throw them and I realize too late that the wind makes @verb@ the arrow to the target. I throw the remaining ones, but I don't @verb@ @noun@s.
Finally, after the count of the @noun@s, I finished @number@th. Not bad, better than @propernoun@. With a @noun@ he @verb@ed @adverb@ a judge. At the next tournament I will @verb@!

VIRTUAL TRAINING
Welcome @propernoun@ to the Legend of @noun@ tutorial. In this @adjective@ game, your goal will be to @verb@ the @adjective@ princes, in the @noun@ of the @noun@'s tundra and to @verb@ all the enemies that will appear before you, using your @adjective@ skills.
From now on I will be your thorn in the side, you will not be able to @verb@ without me telling you how. You won't be able to @verb@ without feeling my breath on your neck.
I @adverb@ see that you have chosen the @noun@ class. This will give you the opportunity to perform the following moves: "@noun@ of the @adjective@ @noun@", the "@noun@'s @noun@", and "@adjective@ @noun@".
You will also have a natural predisposition in handling @noun@s.
In the @noun@ trade and wherever you are, you will always know which direction the closest @noun@ is.
The challenge will not be easy. @number@ pitfalls are hiding around every corner, and many have tried before you, but no one has ever managed to complete the feat. But thanks to your @adjective@ knowledge, you will be able to triumph @adverb@.
Good luck, @adjective@!
Remember that your number of lives is @adjective@.
Try not to @verb@, and to return @adjective@.

GET OUT OF MY MEADOW!
It was <a> @adjective@ and @adjective@ winter day, the sun @verb@ed on the @noun@s and @propernoun@ @verb@ed @adverb@.
At one point he heard the sounds of children playing with @noun@s in his garden. He had certainly not spent @number@ weeks fighting @adverb@, to then be invaded by some kids.
It was so @adjective@ that he decided to call the police. <a> @adjective@ voice replied: "Police station, how can I help you?"
"Some thugs have @verb@ed my garden"
"Mr. Giovanni, you cannot call us every time children play in your garden, goodbye"
So, with his brain clouded by the fumes of the @noun@s, he took his @noun@, and went out to seek justice.
He still remembered his training, using @noun@ to cover himself, and trying not to be seen by enemies. He sent his @noun@ to @verb@ the neighborhood, and found that the children were playing near the vegetable garden.
He remembered his youth when he @verb@ed @noun@s for fun.
It was time to put an end to it, he took aim, and @verb@ed a child @adverb@ in the @noun@. While the others @verb@ed @adverb@, he lit a @noun@ cigar, and returned @adverb@ to play.
